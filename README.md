## File Descriptions

### Python Scripts & Code
- **`blackbody_color.py`**: A helper module that converts a given temperature to its peak wavelength (using Wien's Law) and then to an RGB color equivalent. Useful for visualizing stars based on temperature.
- **`gaia_solar_system_xyz.py`**: A script that queries the Gaia DR3 database for solar system objects. It extracts orbital elements and calculates heliocentric XYZ coordinates and velocities.
- **`query_gaia_solar_system.py`**: A general purpose script to query Gaia DR3 for solar system observation data (RA, Dec, Magnitude). It prioritizes "important" objects (planets, major moons) and includes a random sample of asteroids.
- **`javascript for blender(animation)`**: **Note: This is a Python script** for use within Blender (`import bpy`). It automates the creation of a 3D solar system animation, including generating planets with textures, orbits, and correct axial tilts.

### Jupyter Notebooks
- **`Integrators.ipynb`**: Contains physics simulations for orbital dynamics. It implements a Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) integrator to simulate the orbit of Earth around the Sun.
- **`Planetary_Satellites_List.ipynb`**: A reference notebook containing a structured list of dictionaries with data on various planetary satellites (Moon, Phobos, Deimos, Galilean moons, etc.), including their GM, radius, and density.

### Documentation & Data
- **`Gaia Query Code (wuth xyz conversion)/`**: A folder containing a self-contained Python project (`SolarQuery`).
    - **`gaia_stellar_data.py`**: Queries Gaia DR3 for *stellar* data (stars), retrieving properties like position, parallax, and physical parameters (temperature, mass, radius). It also converts RA/Dec/Parallax to Cartesian XYZ coordinates (in parsecs).
- **`How to Use Gaia Query Code`**: A quick reference guide for running `gaia_stellar_data.py`.
- **`gaia_solar_system_data.csv`, `gaia_solar_system_xyz.csv` & `gaia_solar_system_xyz_30kobjects.csv`**: CSV output files generated by the query scripts. The `30kobjects` file contains a large dataset of ~30,000 solar system objects with their heliocentric XYZ coordinates.
